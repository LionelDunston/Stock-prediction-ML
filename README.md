The article from GeeksforGeeks describes a **stock price prediction model using machine learning (ML) in Python**. Here's a breakdown of the process:  

---

### **1. Overview of the Project**  
The goal is to predict a **trading signal** that indicates whether buying a stock will be profitable. The dataset used is **Tesla stock price data (2010-2017)**, which includes OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) prices.

---

### **2. Libraries Used**
Python libraries used for data handling, visualization, and ML modeling:  
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)  
- **NumPy** (for numerical computations)  
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (for data visualization)  
- **Sklearn** (for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation)  
- **XGBoost** (for building a high-accuracy ML model)  

---

### **3. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**
- **Data Import**: Tesla stock data is read into a Pandas DataFrame.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - **Line Plot**: Shows Tesla’s stock price trend over time.
  - **Distribution & Boxplots**: Check data distribution and outliers.
  - **Correlation Heatmap**: Identifies redundant features.  
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Extracted **day, month, and year** from the date.
  - Added **is_quarter_end** (to capture stock movements at quarter-end).
  - Created new features:  
    - **open-close** = Open price - Close price  
    - **low-high** = Low price - High price  
  - Defined **target variable**:  
    - **1** if the next day’s closing price is higher than today’s, otherwise **0**.

---

### **4. Data Splitting & Normalization**
- Selected features: `open-close`, `low-high`, and `is_quarter_end`.  
- Applied **StandardScaler** for normalization.  
- Split data into **90% training & 10% validation**.

---

### **5. Model Training & Evaluation**
**Machine Learning Models Used**:  
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Polynomial Kernel**  
- **XGBoost Classifier**  

Each model was trained and evaluated using the **ROC-AUC score**:
- Logistic Regression: **54.35% Validation Accuracy**  
- SVM: **44.65% Validation Accuracy**  
- XGBoost: **57.29% Validation Accuracy**  

Among them, **XGBoost performed the best** but showed **overfitting** as training accuracy was **96.44%**, much higher than validation accuracy.

---

### **6. Model Evaluation**
- A **confusion matrix** was plotted to analyze prediction results.
- The accuracy was **not significantly better than random guessing (50%)**, indicating that:
  - More advanced features may be needed.
  - The model is too simple for the complexity of stock price movements.

---

### **7. Platform for Development**
This project can be implemented on:  
1. **Google Colab** *(Recommended - Free GPU, easy setup)*  
2. **Jupyter Notebook** (via Anaconda or VS Code)  
3. **Any Python IDE** (PyCharm, Spyder)
